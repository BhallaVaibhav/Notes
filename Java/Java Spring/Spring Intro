Spring Intro
---------------
	The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. 
	The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.
	
	Unline principles of Spring: RTP - Runtime polymorphism & HAS-A relationship
		- using these 2 principles complete spring has been implemented
		Developers need to follow HAS-A relationship over inheritence. Using runtime polymorphism we can pass required dependencies into POJOs
		
	IOC - Inversion of Control :: Loose Coupling b/w classes ::
	DI 	- Dependancy injection :: How a class gets hold of its dependencies. Constructor DI (for required dependencies) or Setter DI(for optional dependencies) ::
	AOP - Aspect oriented programming :: takes care of cross cutting concerns such as logging, security, declarative txn etc ::
	
	IOC - HAS-A relationship inputs are declared in <bean>.xml file and injected by IOC container to POJO classes. Use runtime polymorphism
			Made possible bcz of containers
	
	IOC Containers:
		- Core container
		- J2EE container
		
	Spring MVC prepared on top of IOC container also has web container
	AOP- Aspects
