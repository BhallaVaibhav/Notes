Q - What are different types of classloaders?
A - There are three types of built-in Class Loaders in Java:
		Bootstrap Class Loader – It loads JDK internal classes, typically loads rt.jar and other core classes.
		Extensions Class Loader – It loads classes from the JDK extensions directory, usually $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext directory.
		System Class Loader – It loads classes from the current classpath that can be set while invoking a program using -cp or -classpath command line options.
		
Q - Java Compiler is stored in JDK, JRE or JVM?
