Thread Group
------------
	Based on functionality we can group threads into a single unit which is nothing but a Thread Group.
	A thread group can contain a group of threads
	In addition to threads, thread group can also contain sub Thread groups
	The main Advantage of maintaining Threads in the form of Thread Group is: 
		- we can perform common operations easily
		eg. yahoo messenger: send wishes to Friends group, relative groups
			set thread priority to group
	
	Note: Every Thread in java belongs to some Thread group :: Thread.getCurrentThread().getThreadGroup().getName()
		  Every Thread group is child thread group of System Thread group.
	eg of System level threads:
		Finalizer, Reference Handler, Signal Dispatcher, Attach Listener
		
	ThreadGroup is direct child class of Object class
