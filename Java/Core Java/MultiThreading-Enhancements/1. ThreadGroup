Thread Group
------------
	Based on functionality we can group threads into a single unit which is nothing but a Thread Group.
	A thread group can contain a group of threads
	In addition to threads, thread group can also contain sub Thread groups
	The main Advantage of maintaining Threads in the form of Thread Group is: 
		- we can perform common operations easily
		eg. yahoo messenger: send wishes to Friends group, relative groups
			set thread priority to group
	
	Note: Every Thread in java belongs to some Thread group :: Thread.getCurrentThread().getThreadGroup().getName()
		  Every Thread group is child thread group of System Thread group.
	eg of System level threads:
		Finalizer, Reference Handler, Signal Dispatcher, Attach Listener
		
	ThreadGroup is direct child class of Object class
	
	Methods:
		String getName();
		int getMaxPriority();
		void setMaxPrority(int p); // has no effect on priority of existing threads
		ThreadGroup getParent();
		void list();
		int activeCount();
		int activeGroupCount();
		int enumerate(Thread[] t); // to copy all active threads in ThreadGroup into provided thread array. Sub-thread group thread would also be considered.
		int enumerate(ThreadGroup[] g); // to copy all active sub-Thread groups into the provided ThreadGroup array.
		boolean isDemon();
		void setDemon(boolean b);
		void interrupt();
		void destroy();

	Q: WAP to print active threads in System group
