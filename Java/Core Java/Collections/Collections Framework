Collections Framework
	contains several classes and Interfaces which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
	
9 key interfaces of Collection Framework
	1. Collection
	2. List
	3. Queue
	4. Set		5. SortedSet		6. NavigableSet
	7. Map		8. SortedMap		9. NavigableMap
	
	
Collection(I) v1.2
	In general, it is considered as root interface of Collections Framework since it contains the most common methods which are applicable for any collection object.
	There is no concrete class which implements Collection interface directly.
	
	Collection vs Collections
		Collection is an Interface.
		Collections is a utility class present in Java.util pacakage to define  several utility methods for Collection objects like sorting, searching etc
		
List(I) v1.2
	- It is child interface of Collection(I)
	- Insertion order needs to be maintained
	- Duplicates allowed
	
	Implementation Classes:
		ArrayList (v1.2)
		LinkedList (v1.2)
		Vector	(v1.0)	-	Legacy 	| but re-engineered in v1.2 to implement List(I)
			Stack (v1.0) - Legacy	| but re-engineered in v1.2 to implement List(I)
			
Set(I) - v1.2
	- duplicates not allowed
	
	Implementation classes:
		HashSet(v1.2)
			LinkedHashSet(v1.4)

SortedSet(I)
	- child interface of Set(I)
	- Duplicates not allowed
	- objects are inserted according to some 

Queue(I) - v1.5
	- follows FIFO - first in first out order
	
	Implementation Classes:
		PriorityQueue
		BlockingQueue
			PriorityBlockingQueue
			LinkedBlockingQueue

All the above interfaces (Collection, List, Set, SortedSet, NavigableSet and Queue ) meant for representing a group of individual objects.
If we want to represent a group of objects as key-value pairs then we should go for Map.

Map(I) v1.2
	HashMap v1.2
		LinkedHashMap v1.2
	WeakHashMap v1.2
	IdentityHashMap v1.4
	Hashtable( extends Dictionary(Abstract class) ) v1.0
		Properties v1.0

SortedMap(I) v1.2
	- it is child interface of Map(I)
	- if we want to represent a group of key-value pairs according to some sorting order of Keys

NavigableMap(I) v1.6
	- it is child interface of SortedMap(I)
	- it defines several methods for navigation purposes
	
	Implementation class
		TreeMap v1.2
	
	
Sorting
	Comparable(I) - default natural sorting
	Comparator(I) - customized sorting
	
Cursor
	Get object 1 by 1 from collection
	- Enumeration v1.0 - Legacy
	- Iterator
	- ListIterator
	
Utility Classes
	Collections
	Arrays
