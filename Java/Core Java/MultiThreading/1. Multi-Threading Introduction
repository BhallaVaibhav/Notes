Muti-Tasking :: Introduction
-------------------------
	Executing multiple tasks simultaneously where
	2 Types:
		1. Multi-Processing :: Process Based 	: 	each task is a separate independent program/process. Best suitable at OS level.
		2. Multi-Threading  :: Thread Based		:   each independant task is part of same program/process.  Best suitable at Program level.
		
	Important areas of Multi-Threading are:
		- To develop multimedia graphics / animations / video games
		- To develop Webservers & application servers
		
	Java provides inbuilt support of multithreading with Rich API ( eg. Thread, Runnable, Thread Group ...) 
	
	Advantage of Multi-Threading:: enhances the performance of a Process
	
	What is a Thread ?
		Thread is the smallest unit of execution of a program
	
	How to define a Thread
		- By Extending Thread Class
		- By Implementing Runnable interface
		
	Thread Scheduler
		If multiple Threads are waiting for execution then the order of execution is decided by Thread Scheduler
		It is part of JVM. Algorithm for Scheduler is JVM dependent.
		Order of execution of Threads or Thread exact output cannot be garanteed but we can provide several possible outputs.
