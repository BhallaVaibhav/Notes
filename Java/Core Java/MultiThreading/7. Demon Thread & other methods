Demon Threads
-------------
	The treads executing in the background are Demon Threads
		eg. Garbage Collector, Attach Listener, Signal Dispatcher
	Main objective of demon threads is to provide support for non-demon threads (main threads)
	Demon threads generally run with low priority but based on our/system requirement demon threads can run with high priority also
	
	public boolean isDemon	:: 	mt.isDemon() - to check if thread is demon thread
	public void setDemon	::	mt.setDemon() - to change demon nature of thread
								demon nature can only be changed before starting of thread or else Exception: IllegalThreadStateException
	
	Demon nature of Thread inherits from parent to child.
		Main thread is non-demon
	
	Is it possible to change demon nature of Main thread?
		No. as JVM already starts the Thread at the very beginning of program.
		
	Once all non-demon threads complete then all demon threads will terminate as well.
	

	Java multiThreading concept is implemented by the following 2 Thread Models:
		Green Thread Model
		------------------
			The thread which is completely managed by JVM without taking help from underlying OS then it is called GREEN Thread
			Most OS doesnt provide support for Green Thread model
			Sun Solaris proivde support for Green Thread model
			Green Thread model is now depricated
			
		Native OS Model
		---------------
			The thread managed by JVM with support for underlying OS
			All windows based OS support only native based OS models
			
	How to stop a Thread?
		public void stop(); - method is now depricated/supperessed.
			run(){
				open db connection
				Read data			- if user calls stop method now then db connection would remain open
				close connection
			}
			
	How to suspend and resume a Thread?
		public void suspend(); - we can suspend a thread by using suspend method of Thread class. Then immediately, the thread will enter into suspended state.
		public void resume();  - we can resume a suspended thread by using resume method of Thread class. Then suspended thread can continue its execution.
		These methods are depricated and not recommended to use.
