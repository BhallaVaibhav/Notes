Synchronization
----------------
Synchronization solves data inconsistency problem on a shared java resource.

Syncronized is a modifier applicable only for methods & blocks but NOT for Classes and Variables
If multiple threads try to operate simultaneously on the same java object(shared resource) then there may be a chance of data inconsistency problem.
To overcome this problem we should go for synchronized keyword.
If a method or block declared as Syncronized then at a time only 1 thread is allowed to execute that method or block on the given object so that data inconsistency problem is not encountered.

Disadvantage: 
It increases waiting time of threads and creates performance problems. 
Hence, if there is no specific requirement then it is not recommended to use synchronized keyword

Object Monitor/Lock:
Internally, syncronization concept is implemented by using lock. Every object in java has a unique lock. 
Whenever we are using synchronized keyword then only lock concept comes into picture.

If a thread wants to execute synchronized method on the given object then it needs to aquire the lock of that object. 
Once Thread gets the lock then it is allowed to execute any synchronized method on that object.
Remaining threads are not allowed to execute any synchronized method simultaneously on that object but are allowed to execute non-synchronized methods simultaneously.
Once method execution completes then automatically Thread releases the lock.
Aquiring and releasing the lock internally taken care by JVM and Programmer not responsible for this activity.

	------------------------
	| Syncronized Area	   |	-> can be accessed by only one Thread
	------------------------
	| Non-Syncronized Area |	-> can be access by as many Thread
	------------------------

	Good programming practice: 
		Where state of object is changing should be in synchronized area 	eg. Add, Update, Delete
		Where state not changing should be in non-synchronized area 		eg. Read 
Static Synchronizated method :: Class level lock
	public static synchronized void wish(name){}
		We will get regular output even if we have 2 shared objects.
	Class Level lock : 	Every class in Java has this unique lock similar to Object level lock. 
				If a thread wants to introduce static syncronization then a class level lock is required.
						
Syncronized Block
	If only few lines of code need syncronization then we should use synchronized block instead of declaring the whole method as synchronized.
	-> Advantages: Doesnt degrade performance
	synchronized(this){... ...} :: If get lock of current object
		If a thread got lock on current object then only it would be execute on this (block) area code
	synchronized(b) {... ...} :: If thread gets lock of particular object b, then only it is allowed to execute this (block) area code
	synchronized(Display.class) :: If thread gets lock of class level lock of Display class then it can execute the block area code
	
	int x = 100
	synchronized(x){ syso(...)}
		->Error: unexpected type found: int required : reference
	synchronized block can only hold lock of object or class type. If we pass integer or any other primitive type then we will get the above error.
	
What is Race Condition?
	if multiple thereads are operating on same java object and causing data inconsistency then we have race conditon
	we can use synchronized concepts to mitigate the same
	
Can a Thread aquire multiple locks?
	Yes but on multiple objects
