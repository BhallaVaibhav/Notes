Concurrent Collections
---------------------

Need of Concurrent Collections
	1. Most of the Traditional Collections are not ThreadSafe
	2. ThreadSafe Collections - Hashtable, Vector
		Methods in Collections class
		- synchronizedList();
		- synchronizedSet();
		- synchronizedMap();
		Problemns in these synchronized methods:
			- only one thread can work at a time. // total collection object is locked
			- crates performance problems
	3. Concurrent modifications problems
		while one thread iterating collection, another thread modifies collection
	
	Due to the above, traditional Collections not suitable for multi-thread scalable applications
	
	What are various Concurrent collections
		- ConcurrentHashMap
		- CopyOnWriteArrayList
		- CopyOnWriteArraySet
