Creating a Spring Boot Project
----------------------------------
	Create a <simple> Maven project
	Configuration pom.xml	: 	https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/

	Create a class with main method <stand alone application>
		Annotate with @ SpringBootApplication -> represents the starting point of Spring Boot
		SpringApplication.run(<MainClass>.class, args);
			- Sets up the default configuration : favours convention over configuration, addresses 80% of the cases
			- Starts Spring application Context : Spring is a container for all ur code that runs on app server such as DataService
			- Performs class path scan: To identify the various annotations a class may have eg. controller or service
			- Starts Tomcat server
			
Add a Conroller to handle requests
-----------------------------------
	A java class
	Marked with Annotations
	Has info about
		- what URL access triggers it?
		- what method to run when accessed?
		
	@RestController at class level - it means you can have methods in this class which map to url request.
	@RequestMapping("/url") - maps to GET request by default. To map to other request, you need to specify it in the annotation.
