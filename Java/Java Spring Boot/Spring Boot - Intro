Spring Boot - Intro
---------------------------
1. What is Spring Boot
2. Spring Boot Features
3. Configuration and Customization


What is Spring Boot ?
--------------------------
	Spring is the spring framework that lets us write enterprise java applications.
	Boot is somthing that lets you bootstrap the spring applications.
		As per defination, Spring Boot (is a Tool that) makes it 
			- easy to create stand-alone, 
			- production grade 
			- spring based Applications that you can just run.
			....create.....Spring based applications....

	It is an opiniated view of how to configure a typical Spring application.

What is Spring?
------------------
	Spring  
		- is an Application Framework that allows you to build Enterprise Java Applications
		- provides a template that allows us to build enterprise applications
			- when writing a business service there are a number of things that we do. 
				- A set of common problems such as Connecting to db, transaction support
			- Spring provides a template that allows you to build enterprise applications. 
		- also has a Programming and configuration model
			- focus on building our business services and let Spring let handle the boilerplate
		- also provide infrastructure support
			- has support for connecting to a database

Problems with Spring
-------------------
	- It is a huge framework (various combinations and ways of building things) and hence overwhelming
	- multiple setup/configuration steps (connect to mongodb,RDBMS)
	- multiple build and deploy steps

	Spring has a lot of capability and flexability and it comes at a cost
	- And we are required to do a whole lot to do exactly do what we want it to do
	- No real starting point or best practice or pathway

	Would it be cool if we can abstract a few of these steps out ?

	This is where Spring Boot comes in handy.

Spring Boot - What does it gives us ?
-----------------------------------
	Spring Boot Features 

	- Opinionated: In the sense that it gives you is a good starting point
		- makes certain configuration choices 
		- certain decisions 
		- and says start with it and see if any changes are required.

	- features the Convention over Configuration concept
		- if you have to do 100 things, it works for 80% things you just need to configure it for the rest 20 percent.

	- is Stand alone
		- typically when we build a web application or a spring applicaiton we get a .war file
			- we need to deploy that war file to a server such as tomcat or some other servlet container / applicaiton server
		- with Spring Boot we get an executable and is ready to run

	- is Production ready
