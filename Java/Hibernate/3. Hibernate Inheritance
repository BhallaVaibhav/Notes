Inheritance (Single Table Stratergy - Default) - V17 & 18
----------------------------------------------------------
@Entity
@Inheritance(stratergy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
@DiscriminatorColumn(name="VEHICLE_TYPE",
                     discrminatorType=DiscriminatorType.String)
public class Vehicle { }

@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue("Bike") - instead of mentioning the className it would store the mentioned value
public class TwoWheeler expends Vehicle {}

Consider the following classes:
  Parent  : Vehicle          - vehcileID, vehicleName
  Child 1 : TwoWheelerClass  - steeringHandle
  Child 2 : FourWheelerClass - steeringWheel
  
Hibernate doesnt create a separate table for the child classes even though they have been marked with Entity annotation.

A single table with the name of parent class "Vehicle" gets created. 
A column DTYPE (Discriminator Type) is added which denotes the type of object stored in the row of the table.
Also, columns for child classes gets created and are only filled by the respective classes. They remain null for other classes.
