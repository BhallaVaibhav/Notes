React.js Intro
--------------
React.js is a javascript library which helps in creating user interfaces with the help of reusable components.
Core ReactJS is about building views or parts of view. Single components or widgets, which you can then dump on to your views

	HTML webpages can be split up into components such as Header, Footer, navBar, mainArea
	ReactJS builds up on this idea of splitting your webpage into reusable components
	
Diff b/w ReactJS and Angular2
	Angular2 is a javascript framework which allows you to build single page applications SPA.
	Diff - Angular2 has out of the box router, supports form validation and so on. Angular2 is there to controll the complete user experience, control the navigation bw pages
	ReactJS on the other hand can be extended to build SPA
	Easier to use React with other libraries such as Larvel, Angular2 is not the same.
